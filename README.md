# SessionRestore

Session Restore is utility that stores and restores your current session. It
tries to capture all open tabs and open programs. It helps you keep you focused
on your task but you can switch immediately to where you left off on another 
workaround.


# Features

You can:
 * store different sessions
 * switch arbitrarily between those sessions
 * define exclusions, like Mail Tabs that shouldn't be closed
 * store sessions online (TODO, hopefully encrypted)
 * it is Open Source not like cupcloud. You control your data!
 * extensible
